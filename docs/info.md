## How it works

This project implements a **4Ã—4 Wallace Tree Multiplier** using **Half Adders and Full Adders** to efficiently compute the product of two 4-bit binary numbers. The Wallace Tree method reduces the number of sequential additions required in multiplication, leading to a **faster and optimized** multiplication process.

### **Key Features:**
- Accepts **two 4-bit inputs (A & B)**.
- Produces an **8-bit product** as output.
- Uses **Half Adders and Full Adders** for Wallace Tree reduction.
- **No clock is required** since it's a combinational circuit.

## How to test

### **Simulation in TinyTapeout**
1. **Apply two 4-bit binary inputs (`A` and `B`).**
2. **Observe the 8-bit output (`Product`).**
3. **Compare the output with expected multiplication results.**
4. **Verify correctness using test cases:**


## External hardware

This project does **not** require any external hardware.

It can be tested using:
- **FPGA implementation** (e.g., Xilinx, Lattice, or TinyTapeout).
- **Simulation tools** like Verilog simulators (EDA Playground, Icarus Verilog).
- **TinyTapeout environment** for ASIC fabrication.

The 8-bit multiplication result can be displayed using:
- **LEDs** (for lower bits).
- **Seven-segment displays** (for visualization of results).
- **UART / GPIO pins** (if extended to communicate with external systems).
